# Image Investigation Tool

A stand-alone, Javascript-only, version of the Drupal module available at https://github.com/agile-humanities/agile_iit.  I've tried to change as little as possible while preserving as much functionality as possible.

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/1c12d89a-0515-4295-a439-45e15ddd1fbb/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/image-investigation-tool/deploys)

If the project is checked-out (`git clone https://github.com/simonwiles/iit.git`), `index.html` can be opened (in a web-browser) directly from the local file system, and everything should work just fine.  Alternatively, a live deployment is available at https://image-investigation-tool.netlify.app/.
